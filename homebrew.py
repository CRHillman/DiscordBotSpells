You endow yourself with unrivaled endurance and martial prowess fueled by powerful magic. Until the spell ends, you canâ€™t cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:

You gain 75 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.


You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.

You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.


You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.


You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.


Your Strength score becomes 12 if it not already higher than that.
